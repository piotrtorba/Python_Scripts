#This simple program is to calculate and convert work time from clock format (1h = 60min)
# to decimal fromat (1h = 100*1.666min.)
#My employer demands monthly work raports in decimal format. OMG!

#Simply enter start time value and finish time value and the program will give you
#two results: 1st the raw result and 2nd the result minus breaktime (45min.)
#To 'Exit' the program type 'stop' and hit 'ENTER'.
